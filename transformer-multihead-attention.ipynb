        "In this notebook we will be implementing a (slightly modified version) of the Transformer model from the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. All images in this notebook will be taken from the Transformer paper. For more information about the Transformer, [see](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/transformers-attention-in-disguise/) [these](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) [three](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) articles.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to the Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence model, the Transformer does not use any recurrence. It also does not use any convolutional layers. Instead the model is entirely made up of linear layers, attention mechanisms and normalization. \n",
        "\n",
        "As of January 2020, Transformers are the dominant architecture in NLP and are used to achieve state-of-the-art results for many tasks and it appears as if they will be for the near future. \n",
        "\n",
        "The most popular Transformer variant is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) (**B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from **T**ransformers) and pre-trained versions of BERT are commonly used to replace the embedding layers - if not more - in NLP models. \n",
        "\n",
        "A common library used when dealing with pre-trained transformers is the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library, see [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) for a list of all pre-trained models available.\n",
        "\n",
        "The differences between the implementation in this notebook and the paper are:\n",
        "- we use a learned positional encoding instead of a static one\n",
        "- we use the standard Adam optimizer with a static learning rate instead of one with warm-up and cool-down steps\n",
        "- we do not use label smoothing\n",
        "\n",
        "We make all of these changes as they closely follow BERT's set-up and the majority of Transformer variants use a similar set-up."
